| `openssl s_client -connect <FQDN/IP>:pop3s` | Connect to the POP3s service. |

**POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):** - POP3 downloads emails from the server to the user's device (computer, smartphone, etc.). - Emails are typically stored locally on the user's device, and the server copy is often deleted after download (though settings can be adjusted to keep copies on the server). - POP3 lacks folder management capabilities, so emails are usually stored in a single inbox. - Suitable for users who want to store emails locally and have limited need for accessing emails across multiple devices.
