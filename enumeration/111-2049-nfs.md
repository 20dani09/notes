Network File System (_NFS_) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers.

| NFSv2   | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| NFSv3   | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                                                                                                                                       |
| NFSv4   | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |

```bash
sudo nmap --script nfs\* $IP -sV -p111,2049
