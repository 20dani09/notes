**IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** - IMAP allows users to access emails directly from the email server. - Emails are stored on the server, and clients synchronize with the server to view, read, and manage emails. - IMAP supports folder management, allowing users to organize emails into different folders on the server. - Ideal for users who need to access emails from multiple devices as emails remain on the server.
